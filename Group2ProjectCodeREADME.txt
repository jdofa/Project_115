This ReadMe file will give a brief explanation on how to run the code/menu of the group 2 project code.

To run Part1.cpp, please make sure that you have the algorithms.h file in the header, which contains the algorthims to run with Part1.cpp.

Once the execution is running a menu will be prompt open which will ask to input a number between 1 to 20.

The menu will show which number will execute what algorthim.

Part2.cpp will run just by itself.

To exit the program, press 20.
