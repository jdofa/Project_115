- ABOUT PROJECT - 
This was a project assigned in the class "CSCI 115: Algorithms and Data Structures" at CSU Fresno.
In Part 1, we analyzed and compared different sorting algorithms given different lists and list sizes.
In Part 2, given a list, we needed to find two numbers that add up to a specific number given through user input. 
The challenge was to create our own algorithm that would be more efficient than a brute force solution.
