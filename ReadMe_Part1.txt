To execute this program you will have to include Part1.cpp along with algorithms.h. The header file contains all 
algorithms to increase the readability of Part1.cpp. In Part1.cpp the first variable declared in the main function 
'size' is used to determine how large the array is. You can change this to get different results and data points.
Once you choose the determined size, you can start the program and choose between 1 - 20. These are choices that
result in a specific algorithm sorting an array in a specific case whether it be its best, worst, or average case.
You can choose as many times as you want. To exit, enter the value 20.
